# Assets

This folder is reserved for images, diagrams, and screenshots to support the Eternal Claude project.

Suggested visuals to include:
- **VM Lifecycle Diagram**: Running → Suspended → Resume (with cost notes).
- **Claude Reset Screenshot**: Example of Claude losing context.
- **VSCode Remote-SSH Screenshot**: Connected to the Eternal Claude VM.
- **Workflow Graphic**: Daily flow (Resume → Work → Suspend).
- **Icons**: Eye (FigmaVision) + Brain (Eternal Claude) to show the series link.

Drop final .png/.jpg/.svg files here and reference them in docs or Medium article drafts.
